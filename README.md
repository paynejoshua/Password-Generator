This intention of this project was to implement many of the concepts that we have learned so far including:
-HTML Layout
-CSS Responsive Design
-JavaScript implementation.

The emphasis was primarily getting the javascript to run data validation, looping through the different arrays, and finally generating a random password based
on the selected criteria. 

I started off by writing some pseudo code for all of my files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to gain a full scope of what I would need for each one. 

For JavaScript I knew I had to tell it to get certain elements in order to build arrays for those elements. I then laid out what arrays I would need to build and then from there I started creating my for loops and conditional statements. 

The difficult part of this project was writing the random generator script. In the end it is a simple concept but was difficult to research and implement. Although now that I have done it I have mored confidence in my abilities. 

Enjoy!
