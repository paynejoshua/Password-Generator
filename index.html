<!-- Sudo Code -->
   <!-- I need to create a form -->
   
    <!-- At the top of the form it needs to say Password Generator -->
    
    <!-- There should be a series of things to include in the password:
       // Uppercase Letters
    // lowercase letters
    // Special characters
    // Length of characters between 8 and 128. Have this be a drop down menu
    // Numeric (Include numbers?)-->
   <!-- There should be a display field that has placeholder text that reads "Password will generate here" -->
    <!-- At the bottom of the form there needs to be a button that says Generate Password -->

    <!-- Here is an example of a password generator: https://passwordsgenerator.net/ -->
